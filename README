stoneyans - stoney's Ansible configuration files

This folder contains the following ansible playbooks:

- stoneysrv.yml: stoney's server build
- stoneydev.yml: stoney's dev environment build
- stoneywin10.yml: stoney's windows 10 general use build

The stoneysrv.yml file contains an Ansible playbook to do the following:

- Apache 2
- PHP7
- MySQL 8
- CakePHP 3

So far no complete Ansible playbook has been created. I currently have finished:

- stoneysrv.yml: install Apache 2
